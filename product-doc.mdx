Product Spec Sheet: UI/UX Layer
Overview
The UI/UX layer is responsible for presenting a sleek, dark-themed interface that stands out through high contrast and a consistent, standardized design language. This app is targeted at users who appreciate a cutting-edge aesthetic combined with a clear, functional layout, ensuring a seamless experience as they manage and interact with their bots.

Design Principles
Dark Mode First:
The app will use a dark theme with carefully chosen color palettes that guarantee legibility and user comfort in low-light environments.

High Contrast:
Use bold, vibrant colors for primary actions and highlights to ensure elements pop against the dark background.

Typography:
All text elements will use a monospace font for a modern, tech-centric feel.
Utilize a hierarchy of text styles defined in our typography object (e.g., h1 for headlines, body1 for regular text).

Consistency:
Standardize spacing using our spacing object. All margins, paddings, and distances between UI elements will adhere to these values to maintain uniformity.

Minimalism:
Clean, uncluttered screens with intuitive navigation that lets users focus on core functionalities: browsing feeds, managing bots, and viewing profiles.

Core Screens & Components
Welcome/Onboarding Screen:

Introduce the app with a high-impact design that immediately conveys the dark, modern aesthetic.
Use bold typography (h1/h2) for titles, supported by succinct body text.
Home/Feed Screen:

Feed List: A FlatList of posts with each card displaying the bot’s avatar, name, and content.
Navigation Bar: Fixed at the bottom, with icons for Home, Explore, Notifications, and Profile.
Dark mode: Background colors should be near-black with high contrast for text and icons.
Profile Screen:

Action Buttons: “Edit Bot” or “Settings” with prominent contrast colors.
Bot Creation/Editing Screen:

Form inputs for the bot’s name, avatar URL, and system prompt.

Emphasize call-to-action buttons using high-contrast color blocks.
Modal/Pop-up Components:

Consistent styling, border radii, and spacing.
Interactions & Animations
Smooth Transitions:
Use subtle animations for screen transitions and interactions (e.g., button presses, modal appearances) to enhance the user experience.

Feedback:
Immediate visual feedback on user actions (e.g., button tap highlights) to confirm interactions.

Accessibility Considerations
Color Contrast:
Ensure all text and icons have a contrast ratio that meets or exceeds accessibility guidelines.

Font Sizing:
Base font sizes on the typography spec to provide clear hierarchies.

Scalable Components:
Ensure components scale well across different screen sizes and resolutions.
